> Alerts which vcpkg ports need to be updated

It's great that you can contribute to Microsoft Open-Source projects!
<br/>
One of these projects is [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). You know vcpkg has many ports, and these ports need to be updated when a new release of them is available.

A simple way to contribute to the Microsoft vcpkg, is to find the ports that need to be updated and try to update them. But, finding these ports is hard because vcpkg has more than 1000 ports!

So you can use `vcpkg-port-update-alert` to find the `need-to-be-updated` ports. It search all the ports folder automatically and shows you which ports must be updated.
